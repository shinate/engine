    * Directional, point and spot lights (all of which can cast shadows)
    * Static and skinned meshes
    * Keyframed animation support
    * Particle engine with editor
    * Physically based rendering (PBR)
    * PostFX library: bloom, edge detect, FXAA, vignette, etc
    * Seamless default material support from Maya, 3DS Max, Blender, etc.
    * Full model export pipeline from Maya, 3DS Max, Blender, etc via [PlayCanvas Tools](https://playcanvas.com)
* **Collision & Physics**
    * Full integration with 3D rigid-body physics engine [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js)
* **Audio**
    * 3D Positional audio via Web Audio API
* **Resource Loading**
    * Simple and powerful resource loading
* **Entity / Component System**
    * Built-in components: audiosource, animation, camera, collision, light, rigidbody, script
* **Scripting system**
    * Write game behaviours by attaching JavaScript to game entities.
* **Input**
    * Mouse, Keyboard, Touch, Gamepad support

## Usage

Here's a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```html
<script>
    // Create a PlayCanvas application
    var canvas = document.getElementById("application-canvas");
    var app = new pc.Application(canvas, {});
    app.start();

    // Fill the available space at full resolution
    app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
    app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

    // Create box entity
    var cube = new pc.Entity();
    cube.addComponent("model", {
        type: "box"
    });

    // Create camera entity
    var camera = new pc.Entity();
    camera.addComponent("camera", {
        clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
    });

    // Create directional light entity
    var light = new pc.Entity();
    light.addComponent("light");

    // Add to hierarchy
    app.root.addChild(cube);
    app.root.addChild(camera);
    app.root.addChild(light);

    // Set up initial positions and orientations
    camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);
    light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

    // Register an update event
    app.on("update", function (deltaTime) {
    	cube.rotate(10 * deltaTime, 20 * deltaTime, 30 * deltaTime);
    });
</script>
```
